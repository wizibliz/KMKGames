# KMKGames
A list of different game implementations for KeyMasters Keep, a custom game for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg)
# Features Games and their challenges
- At the moment NOTHING! Planning on just doing games I personally enjoy, no idea what those are just yet though :P
  
# Requirements
- Have [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) installed and setup

# Usage
To use the following files, here are some brief instructions
1. Head over to the [latest release of KeyMasters Keep](https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases/tag/kmk-0002) (Last checked 03/07/2025) and setup the Keymasters keep first.
2. Grab the raw file of any of the .py implementations (by clicking on them and then pressing the "Download raw file" button on it
3. Add that python file to /Archipelago/keymasters_keep/
4. Regenerate the default version of the KeyMasters Keep YAML by going to archipelago launcher -> Generate Template Options (Or whatever equivalent works for you)
5. Open Keymasters_keep.yaml in the templates folder, all of the games added *should* be there, if they are not, restart your archipelago launcher and repeat step 4.
